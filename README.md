# Always Look on the Bright Side of Life

`monty-python-landing` is a simple landing page containing the lyrics of the famous song by Monty Python - "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life."

The page was created for the purpose of learning Git in the Bootcamp Fullstack Developer course by Kodilla company.

## Installation

### For developers

There is `package.json` including `browser-sync` in the project. If you want to see your changes immediately in the browser you can install dependencies and then run `browser-sync` as follows:

```
npm install
```

```
node_modules/.bin/browser-sync start --server --files "css/*.css" "*.html"
```


## Used technologies

```
HTML, CSS
```

I've just played with CSS background and parallax effect. There were no top-down assumptions about the appearance of the site.
