                Some things in life are bad<br>
                They can really make you mad<br>
                Other things just make you swear and curse<br>
                When you're chewing on life's gristle<br>
                Don't grumble, give a whistle<br>
                And this'll help things turn out for the best<br>
                And
            </p>
            <p class="chorus">
                Always look on the bright side of life<br>
                Always look on the light side of life
            </p>
            <p>
                If life seems jolly rotten<br>
                There's something you've forgotten<br>
                And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing<br>
                When you're feeling in the dumps<br>
                Don't be silly chumps<br>
                Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing<br>
                And
            </p>
            <p class="chorus">
                Always look on the bright side of life<br>
                (Come on)<br>
                Always look on the right side of life
            </p>
            <p>
                For life is quite absurd<br>
                And death's the final word<br>
                You must always face the curtain with a bow<br>
                Forget about your sin<br>
                Give the audience a grin<br>
                Enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow
            </p>
            <p class="chorus">
                So always look on the bright side of death<br>
                A just before you draw your terminal breath
            </p>
            <p>
                Life's a piece of shit<br>
                When you look at it<br>
                Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true<br>
                You'll see it's all a show<br>
                Keep 'em laughin' as you go<br>
                Just remember that the last laugh is on you<br>
                And
            </p>
            <p class="chorus">
                Always look on the bright side of life<br>
                Always look on the right side of life<br>
                (C'mon Brian, cheer up)<br>
                Always look on the bright side of life<br>
